```

What is the proportion of $p_F$ of forest in the area of interest (box)?

* Given we can plan the sampling, how should we do that?
* Given a sample has already been taken, what are our options to estimate $p_F$?

```{r echo=FALSE}
n = 50
set.seed(100)
s = st_sample(aoi, n)
plot(x["f",,,1], reset = FALSE, key.pos = 4, key.length = .4, key.width = lcm(5), main = NULL)
plot(s, add = TRUE, col = 'orange', pch = 3)
v = st_extract(x["f",,,1], s)
```

## 95% CI, design-based, simple random sampling

Sample mean (n = `r n`):
```{r}
(m = mean(v$f == "Forest"))
```

95% CI using normal approximation (CLT, n large, $m$ not too close to 0 or 1):
```{r}
se = sqrt(m * (1 - m) / n)
m + qnorm(c(.025,.975)) * se
```

True mean (fraction over this whole single image):
```{r echo=FALSE}
population_mean = mean(x["f",,,1][[1]] == "Forest")
c(population_mean = population_mean)
```

## What does this confidence interval mean?

(we use small $s$ for a fixed variable, capital $S$ for a random variable)

* it is a design-based estimate: observations on a variable $z$ at locations $s$ are considered as coming from a random sampling process, $z(S)$, with $S$ randomly sampled from the area of interest $A$: $S$ is a random variable, $z$ is fixed (as is $z(s)$).
* because of random sampling, _any_ pair $\{z(S_i),~z(S_j)\}$ are independent, and their separation distance $|S_i-S_j|$ is again a random variable
* the CI means that **under repeated sampling** (using the same procedure), on average 95 out of 100 cases this CI will include the population parameter $p_F$.

## Replicates: repeated sampling

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.width=9.5,fig.height=2.5}
nr = 6
layout(matrix(1:11, 1), widths = c(1,.1,1,.1,1,.1,1,.1,1,.1,1))
for (i in 1:nr) {
  plot(x["f",,,1], reset = FALSE, key.pos = NULL, main = NULL)
  plot(st_sample(aoi, n), add = TRUE, col = 'orange', pch = 3)
  if (i < nr) plot.new()
}
```
...

## CI coverage: repeated sampling

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.width=9.5,fig.height=5}
m = sapply(1:100, function(y) mean(st_extract(x["f",,,1], st_sample(aoi, n))$f == "Forest", 
	na.rm = TRUE))
se = sqrt(m * (1 - m) / n)
int = cbind(m + qnorm(.025) * se, m + qnorm(.975) * se)
plot(1:100, m, pch = 3, cex = .5, xlim = c(0,101), ylim = c(0, .7), xlab = "sample", ylab = "fraction forest")
segments(1:100, int[,1], y1 = int[,2])
abline(h = population_mean, lty = 2, col = 'red')
```

(red line: population mean `r population_mean`)

## model-based 95% CI

* model-based, we assume $z(s)$ to be a realisation (sample of size 1) of a superpopulation (random field) $Z(s)$
* we postulate (assume) a model, e.g. $Z(s) = m + e(s)$, with $m$ a spatial constant unknown mean (fixed effect), and $e(s)$ a spatially correlated random variable (random effect)
* For stationary random fields, Correlation of $Z(s_i)$ and $Z(s_j)$ are assumed to be correlated as a function of distance: $\mbox{Cov}(Z(s_i), Z(s_j)) = C(h)$, with $h=|s_i-s_j|$
* sampling strategy does "not" play a role: can be anything, but ignoring biases leads to disaster, as anywhere in statistics

## Estimating $m$?

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.width=9.5,fig.height=2.5}
nr = 6
layout(matrix(1:11, 1), widths = c(1,.1,1,.1,1,.1,1,.1,1,.1,1))
for (i in 1:nr) {
  plot(x["f",,,i], reset = FALSE, key.pos = NULL, main = NULL)
  plot(s, add = TRUE, col = 'orange', pch = 3)
  if (i < nr) plot.new()
}
```

* the boxes show _independent_ realisations of $Z(s)$, _unconditional_ to any measurements
* $m$ is a property of the whole random field $Z(s)$, not just the realisation at hand
(unconditional to the observations)
* it is also in no way spatially restricted to the area of interest
* "true" $m$ is `r 1-pnorm(0.5)` (parameter of generating process)

## Predicting $Z(A)$

* Model-based, $s$ is no longer random so we can predict $Z(s_0)$ by $\hat{Z}(s_0)=\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(s_i)$ (with $\lambda_i$ the kriging weights) for _any_ $s_0$ (kriging interpolation): estimates _probability_ of $Z(s_0)$ being forest
* This means that we can also predict the area mean $Z(A)=\frac{1}{|A|}\int_A Z(u)du$, e.g.
using the mean of predictions over the area: 
$$\frac{1}{K}\sum_{j=1}^K \hat{Z}(s_j)$$ 
this is the _block kriging_ prediction; it comes with a block
kriging standard error that takes all the correlations between
the $\hat{Z}(s_j)$ into account: block kriging deals with _change
of support_

 
## Required: variogram

```{r echo=FALSE}
vg = variogram(f == "Forest" ~1, na.omit(v))
v.fit = fit.variogram(vg, vgm(1, "Sph", 30))
plot(vg, v.fit)
```

## Kriging predictions:

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.width=10}
kr = krige(f == "Forest" ~ 1, v, grd, v.fit, debug.level = 0)
kr$Population = x["f",,,1] == "Forest"
names(kr)[1] = "Kriging prediction"
hook = function(x) plot(s, add = TRUE, col = 'orange', pch = 3)
plot(merge(kr[c(1,3)]), hook = hook, breaks = "equal", col = rev(grey(2:10/12)))
```

Left: predictions of $\hat{p}(Z(s) = \mbox{"Forest"})$, Right: population

## Block kriging for the whole of $A$

Block kriging prediction:
```{r echo=FALSE}
bl = krige(f == "Forest" ~ 1, v, aoi, v.fit, debug.level = 0)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
c(predicted_mean = bl$var1.pred)
ci = bl$var1.pred + qnorm(c(.025,.975)) * sqrt(bl$var1.var)
setNames(ci, c("p.025", "p.975"))
```

Compare to design-based mean estimate:
```{r echo=FALSE}
c(estimated_mean = m <- mean(v$f == "Forest"))
se = sqrt(m * (1 - m) / n)
setNames(m + qnorm(c(.025,.975)) * se, c("p.025", "p.975"))
```

## What does the block kriging CI refer to?

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.width=9.5,fig.height=2.1}
cs <- krige(f == "Forest" ~ 1, v, grd, v.fit, 
	nmax = 20, beta = .27, nsim = 6, debug.level = 0, indicators = TRUE)
cs$f = factor((cs < 0.5)[[1]], labels = c("Forest", "Non-Forest"))
plot(cs["f"], hook = hook, key.pos = 1, key.length = .4, key.width=lcm(1))
```

CI's reflect averaging over the _conditional_ random fields $Z(s)|z(s_i),i=1.,,,.n$ that:

* have mean $m$ and covariance $C(h)$
* are conditioned to ("obey the") sample data, i.e. $Z(s_i)=z(s_i)$ for all observations $i$, but are otherwise independent

## Machine learning example
```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
data <- data.frame(st_coordinates(v),"f"=v$f)
set.seed(100)
model <- train(data[,c("X","Y")],data$f,method="rf",trControl = trainControl(method="cv"),
               savePredictions=TRUE,importance=TRUE)

prediction_dat <- st_coordinates(x)
names(prediction_dat) <- c("X","Y")
x$prediction=predict(model,prediction_dat)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%",message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

print(paste0("Model accuracy: ",model$results$Accuracy, ". Really?"))

plot(x["f",,,1], reset = FALSE, key.pos = 4, key.length = .4, key.width = lcm(5), main = NULL)
plot(s, add = TRUE, col = 'orange', pch = 3)

plot(x["prediction",,,1], reset = FALSE, key.pos = 4, key.length = .4, key.width = lcm(5), main = NULL)
plot(s, add = TRUE, col = 'orange', pch = 3)
```

* How was the model validated?
* No sensible standard errors of area estimates

## Comparison design-based / model-based

1. design-based methods do not need a model, and are more robust: model-based approaches lean on an assumed model.
2. design-based models are robust only if random sampling was used, and inclusion probabilities (sample weights) are known
3. model-based approaches make no assumption about sampling, but also have no guard against biased sampling
4. model-based approaches can make predictions for _any_ location, and predict means over regions of _any_ shape; design-based only estimate _averages_ over the sampled region(s).
5. the probability statements differ: design-based CI's refer to repeating the sampling procedure, model-based CI's refer to (conditional) super-populations under a fixed sample.

## Why we use R

* R is a data science language
* All numbers and figures in these slides were generated by R (where
the commands were mostly suppressed, to avoid clutter): 
    * this makes them 100% reproducible, and
	* a source for further experimentation
	* literate programming helps explaining code, computation, and intention
	* source of slides is found [here](https://github.com/edzer/eo4statistics/blob/master/slides.Rmd)
	* copy-and-paste errors are ruled out
* R has a number (> 16K) of extension packages, many of them for spatial statistics, well maintained, well tested.
* R has the advantage that installation of extension packages on a variety of hardware (Mac OSX, Windows, or Linux) is relatively painless.
